    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>

    <h3>What is HTML ?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup
      <b>Language</b>. It's a markup language that web developers use to
      structure and describe the content of a webpage (not aprogramming
      language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can learn more at the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank"> MDN Web
        Docs.</a></p>



    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
